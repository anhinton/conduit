\description{
Run a pipeline
}
\details{
This function will attempt to run an OpenAPI \code{pipeline} list object,
either loaded from a pipeline .XML file with \code{loadPipeline} or created
with \code{pipeline} function.

The function should produce a directory called \file{pipelines} in the
working directory where it will produce its \code{module}s' results.

First the function will determine the order in which its modules are to
be run. Note that the \code{pipeline} is not allowed to have any cycles or
the function will fail.

The function then determines the file paths of the objects described in
the \code{pipe}s as inputs/outputs.

Finally the function runs each \code{module} in the order determined,
feeding each \code{module} its inputs. A directory will be created for each
\code{module} in \file{pipelines/modules}, in which the function will save
the script used to run the \code{module}, and its outputs.
